# My Shop App- :Introduction
It is a common thing everyone have witnessed in their life that while visiting shops,
there is a lot of wastage of time to ask for their requirements and sometimes this may
result into quarrel. Also, in the time of this global pandemic the need of the hour is to
come up with the method which can ensure social distancing.
In order to solve this problem, we have decided to make an application which will
ensure that customers can directly place their order by logging in to their account and pay
the required amount.
